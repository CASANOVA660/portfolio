# ðŸ’» Terminal Portfolio

Terminal Portfolio is as the name suggests a terminal-themed portfolio showcasing a bit about myself and my projects.
It's lightning-fast featuring nearly perfect Lighthouse Scores and clean UI and good UX.

On Desktop the portfolio items will be displayed with Winbox instances allowing users to resize, move and treat them as separate instances of 'terminal'.
On Mobile, the portfolio items will be displayed as static sites generated by Gatsby for better User Experience and window controls of the device.
